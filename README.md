# NOTES

A stupid simple "taking notes" app, syncing to localstorage.

God willing, also to dropbox.

Who knows, maybe Firebase?


### Get it started

To build the app, install grunt and all its dependencies.

```javascript
npm install grunt // install grunt
npm install 	  // install project dependencies

grunt             // run projects default grunt task, generates a /build folder
```

To start development watchers:

```javascript
grunt watch
```


bara till github!!!
